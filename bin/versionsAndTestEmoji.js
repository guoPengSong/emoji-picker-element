// Find one good representative emoji from each version to test by checking its color.
// Ideally it should have color in the center. For some inspiration, see:
// https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/05/30/journey-in-native-unicode-emoji/
//
// Note that for certain versions (12.1, 13.1), there is no point in testing them explicitly, because
// all the emoji from this version are compound-emoji from previous versions. So they would pass a color
// test, even in browsers that display them as double emoji. (E.g. "face in clouds" might render as
// "face without mouth" plus "fog".) These emoji can only be filtered using the width test,
// which happens in checkZwjSupport.js.
//
// Also note that for the 0.6 emoji, we actually need a variation selector to make it color:
